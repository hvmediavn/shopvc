To **hide all the common Wordpress paths** you need the PRO version. Check all the PRO security features below.

The admin URL is the most common path that hackers use to break your Wordpress site.

Being able to cover up the common paths is critical, because you get to keep intruders away from sensitive website data.

This is crucial, and it will provide you with a great experience and really good results in the long term.

It will surely be worth it, not to mention that hiding the common paths will make hacking a lot harder as well.

If you don't protect yourself, you will end up having a hacked site sooner or later.


**This is a free version of the plugin so you can use it for all your blogs without any restrictions.**

No theme or other plugins functionality will be blocked, everything will function the same

Note: The plugin requires custom permalinks. Make sure you have it activated at Settings > Permalinks

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is this plugin working on WP Multisite? =

Yes, this feature is only available on the Hide My Wordpress PRO version.

The PRO version also works with Apache, Nginx, IIS and LiteSpeed servers

Please visit: <a href="https://wpplugins.tips/wordpress">https://wpplugins.tips/wordpress</a>


= I forgot the custom login and admin URLs. What now? =

Don't panic.

You can still access your site with the secure parameter
http://domainname/wp-login.php?hmw_disable=[your_code]

= Locked out of my site!  I set the plugin, and when I left I can't manage to get in =

Rename the plugin directory /wp-content/plugins/hide_my_wp so that the plugins wouldn't hide the wp-admin path

Save it and it should be back from where you left it.

Make sure you remember the secure parameter, and it will be much simpler.

= Is this plugin working if I don't have custom permalinks on my site? =

No. You need to have custom permalinks set on in Settings > Permalinks.

You will get a notification in the Settings page if something is not setup right.


= What to do before I deactivate the plugin? =

It's better to switch to Default mode in Settings > Hide my wp.

If you don't, the plugin will automatically change your site back to the safe URLs, and it will tell you what to do in case you don't have write permission for the config files

_______________________________________________________________________

= Is this Plugin free of charge? =

Yes. The Lite features of Hide My WP plugin will always be free.

We will include all the required Wordpress Security updates.

To unlock all the features, please visit please visit: <a href="https://wpplugins.tips/wordpress">https://wpplugins.tips/wordpress</a>


= Is this plugin enough to protect my website from all hackers? =

The free version of Hide My WP hides the wp-admin and wp-login as described but will not protect you from all the hackers attack.

Hide My Wordpress PRO hides all the common paths and patterns used but bots to detect that you are using Wordpress.

We also recommend you to install Premium Themes and Plugins and not just any Wordpress plugin because the free plugins are usually made by beginners and they don't have security knowledge.
